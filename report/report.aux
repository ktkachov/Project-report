The cell numbers are shown inside the quadrilaterals formed by the nodes (circles) and edges (edges connecting the nodes). Together with the indirection map, we also store an integer $dim \in \mathbb  {N}$ which specifies the dimension of the mapping. Thus, the data associated with element $i$ are stored in the range $[i*dim$, ... , $i*(dim+1)-1]$ of the relevant indirection map (in the example: the nodes associated with edge 3 are stored at indices $3*2=6$ and $3*2+1=7$). Note: in the edge-to-cell map $-1$ represents a boundary cell that may be handled in a special way by a computational kernel. \relax }}{10}}
